##Q&A
###Can I use this bot as-is?
No, you need to create a solution and project in Visual Studio but can drop these files in it. You also need to add your unique strings to the Web.config. You may also need to set up the Properties folder with AssemblyInfo.cs file. I suggest you just make a new Bot Framework project in Visual Studio and this should all be taken care of.
###Can I add your bot on Skype and use it?
Fineas isn't published officially yet. You can reach him on Skype, but I ask you not to as there is a limited amount of friends he can have until I publish him! Also, if you're not a part of Microsoft, he should shun you anyway..

##Release notes
Currently it hasn't been released at all. Still in "Alpha"

##Point to AuthBot
My manager made this tool I used for AD verification called AuthBot. https://github.com/matvelloso/AuthBot
